/** This is ALMOST COMPLETE TEMPLATE CODE for the MiniDraw
 * integration exercise. Find the TODO's in the code below
 * and use the 'ShowUpdate' visual test to implement
 * the missing aspects.
 *
 * HotStoneDrawing implements the Drawing role of MiniDraw (i.e. is
 * the 'Model' component of MVC holding all the Figures that MiniDraw
 * will draw on the screen) as well as the role of GameObserver (i.e.
 * receives events on all state changes in the underlying HotStone
 * game, so the Drawing can update the associated figures - which will
 * trigger a graphical redraw of the window).
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * It is designed as a composition of standard implementations from
 * MiniDraw for figureCollection and Listener handling (for figure
 * changes and drawing changes), while of course implement all the
 * special behaviour required for the HotStone game GFX itself.
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * All manipulations of the Figures in the Drawing are through the
 * GameObserver role: Any event notifications from the game (like
 * onCardDraw or onCardRemove) are translated into the equivalent
 * graphical representation like adding or removing figures to
 * Drawing, updating figure graphics, etc., leading to the UI is
 * updated.
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * As all game events are expressed in terms of instances of 'Card' or
 * 'Hero', internal mappings (actorMap and heroMap) are maintained using
 * the card/hero as key, and having the associated Figure as value. It
 * is **VITAL** that this mapping is maintained correctly - any card
 * add events must create a figure and add it to the mapping. Do not
 * mutate the actorMap directly, rather use the private methods to
 * update it (createActor... and removeActor...) as there is internal
 * state that must be kept consistent.
