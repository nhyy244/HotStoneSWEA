What is this?
=============

This is a demonstration of the 'Personal Deck' library, which is
an external library which can create cards for a HotStone game.

How do I use it?
----

Make sure you have Java 7+ and Gradle installed. Then simply

    gradle demo
    
This will download the library from Bærbak's repository, and read two
decks and print out their cards.


Next step?
----

Find the source code in the `src` folder and read it, to learn how to
use the library in your own HotStone.
